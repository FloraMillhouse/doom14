Doom14: Hell in space is a fork of space station 14 with the aim of making ss14 into a semi-boomershooter. Heavily inspired by Doom (1993) and Doom 2: Hell on earth alongside the early Quake games.

Essentially, 24/7 deathmatch with cool guns and you get to post clips of you completely decimating the lobby.
